''' Write a python program named Lab11b_Act2.py to play a number guessing game. Have your program
display a short message with instructions, then continually prompt the user to guess a number. With
each wrong guess, let the user know if their guess is too high or too low. When the user correctly
guesses the number, output the total number of guesses made. Write your program using at least three
(3) functions. You may format the output however you wish; this activity will be manually graded. An
example is shown below. '''
