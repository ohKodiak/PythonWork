import numpy as np

# Create and initialize variables
A = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4) # creates a 3x4 matrix, numbers 0-11
B = np.arange(8).reshape(4, 2) # creates a 4x2 matrix, numbers 0-7
C = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3) # creates a 2x3 matrix, numbers 0-5

# Print arrays
print("A =", A)
print()
print("B =", B)

print("C =", C)

# Calculations
# matrix multiplication
D = A @ B @ C
# print D and D^T
print("D =", D)
print()
print("D^T =", D.T) # transpose of D
print()
# square root
E = np.sqrt(D) / 2
# print E
print("E =", E)
